# Power-of-Language-Predicting-Kickstarter-Campaigns-Success-via-Textual-Contents
## Term project for Web Mining
- Non-textual data is collected from [Kickstarter Datasets - Web Scraping Service](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/), while textual data is scraped from the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) website itself by my teammate [Shanru Lin](https://github.com/shanrulin). I was responsible for data cleaning, EDA, and NLP. Another teammate Yang Wu was in charge of the modeling part.
- This project investigated the role of textual contents in a crowdfunding campaign, giving both investors and kickstarters a new perspective to evaluate a campaign and make decisions.
